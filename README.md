✅ Introduction

▶️ To complete my Data Analysis project I am using TMDb movies dataset.

▶️ This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

▶️ Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
   There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column.
   The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.




✅ From this dataset we could try to solve many different questions such as :

▶️ Is there an improvement in the quality of movies from year to year?

▶️ What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?

▶️ Is the number of movies increase from year to year?

▶️ Is there a relation between a movie runtime and the vote average?

▶️ Who are the top 5 directors according to high revenues?

▶️ longest and shortest runtime values?

▶️ What is the most number of films for every genres all over the time?

▶️ largest and lowest budgets?

▶️ most and least earned revenu?

▶️ Who are the actors that have participated in more movies?

▶️ Average runtime?
